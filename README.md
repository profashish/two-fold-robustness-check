# two-fold-robustness-check
A two-fold redundant sparse array can provide a double difference base and can therefore tolerate single-element failures. Each difference in a two-fold redundant sparse array can be generated at least twice as it contains at least two element pairs to generate a given difference. Therefore, the failure of one element in the array does not prevent the occurrence of a given difference as there would be another pair of elements available for that. In the context of sparse rulers, this can be framed as “a sparse ruler with N marks and length L, that can measure all differences from 0 to L-1 at least twice. The difference L can however be measured only once using the marks at 0 and L”.
